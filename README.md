![Balance HUD](/screenshots/balance_hud.png)

EnderPay adds economy to forge servers.
The diffculty that appers when one wants to add economy to the server is where the credits should come from.
To solve that problem EnderPay introduces basic income and stamped money.

By default the user gets 100 credits on first login, and 50 for each (real time) day, as long as they login at least once every 6 days.
Each day 1% of user balance is taken from him and 1% of each banknote's value is lost.
The amount of tax taken each day is configurable (as well as other values)
