# Grand Economy - The Economy API
This mod can be used as a way to support other economy mods/plugins, all in one place. This means you can use any of these other economies' currencies with any mod that uses Grand Economy, instead of having to use Grand Economy's currency. Currently, it supports any economy from Sponge, as well as EnderPay, Forge Essentials, and Vault (Limited Vault support - not all Vault plugins work with all Grand Economy mods. I recommend SimpleEco for best compatibility). To do so, you set the "economyBridge" config option to the economy whose currency you wish to use. That's all it takes!

# Grand Economy - The Standalone Economy
By itself, Grand Economy has a basic economy of its own for users that don't wish to use another economy mod. It doesn't do much, but it does add a basic income system, as well as commands to interact with players' currency and the ability to convert items into currency. Server owners can set which items can be converted and how much currency should be received.

By default the user gets 100 credits on first login, and 50 for each (real time) day, as long as they login at least once every 5 days. These amounts are configurable.
